"""AgentCore Platform v1.0 — InputHydrateNode for ENE-C2-142 (inner workflow entry).

Node contract:
 - Extend FunctionNode; implement execute(state) -> dict.
 - Return ONLY the fields this node changes (never {**state}).
 - Return AgentStatus.<X>.value strings — never the bare Enum object.
 - Constructible with no arguments (PB-6 instantiates every node via node_cls()).
 - Never import from mediator/, api/, src/graph/, or other agents.

Responsibility (docs/02 — inner `input_hydrate` row):
 - The inner graph receives its `user_input` as the JSON string the outer GraphNode.extract_input()
   produced from the canonical validated_input. This node parses that string back into the hydrated
   `workflow_input` and RE-VALIDATES it after the string handoff (defence against corruption crossing
   the boundary), reusing the SAME input-contract validator as the outer pre_process — it does not
   re-implement or widen the contract. It writes ONLY `workflow_input` and `status` (owned delta);
   the downstream inner nodes read `workflow_input` from there.
 - Fail-closed with a non-sensitive error CODE (never payload content) on a missing / non-string /
   malformed / contract-violating handoff, with no partial output.

S-1: inner node — required_trust_level = ANONYMOUS (S-1 enforced at the outer VERIFIED_EXTERNAL
boundary; declared explicitly).
